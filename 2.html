It was invented by "Dennis Ritchie" in 1972 and then published in 1978, to develop a new version of Unix; The Unix operating system used assembly language, the lowest level of programming that could be read by a computer</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">C ++ is a medium-level programming language, as it relies on a low-level C language but has more advanced capabilities. Since it was first published in 1985, it has become a very versatile programming language, which is used alongside C in developing operating systems.</font></td>
					<td><font size="5" align="center">C # is technically more complex than the three languages, its syntax is less error prone than C or C ++ and can be learned relatively quickly. C # combines the functions of C and C ++ with Visual Basic, and is used on many operating systems, not just Windows. While C ++ supports object-oriented programming and procedural programming, C # is an object-oriented programming language only</font></td>
